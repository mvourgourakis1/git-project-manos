# git-project-manos
1. stage() works like the "add()" method from day 2

2. commit() works by first staging the entire working directory

3. i did not code checkout

4. i ran into an issue with adding the same files multiple times while committing, but fixed them by adding a method that erases duplicate lines in the index file after committing..
